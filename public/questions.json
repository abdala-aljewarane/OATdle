            },
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Snell's Law (n1*sin(θ1) = n2*sin(θ2)) dictates that when light enters a medium with a lower refractive index (n2 < n1), the angle of refraction (θ2) must be greater than the angle of incidence (θ1), meaning the light ray bends away from the normal."
